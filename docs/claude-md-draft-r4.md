# Gemini Spec Output — Loop 5: Full Spectrum Upgrade Prompts

**Recommendation:** The paid tier is completely invisible to users. Making "Full Spectrum" visible is the most direct way to convert engaged visitors into paying users.

## Build Spec

### Principles
- Contextual, not disruptive — prompts appear where users naturally seek more value
- Value-oriented — clearly state what the user gains
- Aesthetic alignment — HUD design language

### Components
1. Centralized subscription hook (`useSubscription`)
2. Reusable upgrade prompt component (HUD-styled)
3. Integration points: Brain search (when hitting limits), Signal detail panel, Terminal widgets
