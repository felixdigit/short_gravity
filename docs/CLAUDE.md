# MICROKERNEL: DOCUMENTATION
You are working in the documentation directory.

YOUR LAWS OF PHYSICS:
1. READ-ONLY REFERENCE: This directory contains project documentation. Do not create application code here.
2. MARKDOWN ONLY: All documents are Markdown (`.md`).
3. NO SECRETS: Never include API keys, passwords, or credentials in documentation files.
