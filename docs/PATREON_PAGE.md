# Short Gravity — Patreon Page

## Page Description

Short Gravity is an independent space sector intelligence platform — built to track, analyze, and decode the companies building the future of connectivity from orbit.

The Terminal at shortgravity.com is open to everyone: live satellite tracking, SEC/FCC filing archives, global patent data, and an AI research assistant that can search across 4,000+ records.

**What Patreon unlocks:**

The public AI gives you answers. The paid tier gives you alpha.

Subscribers get an enhanced AI brain with deeper context windows, full citation chains across filings and patents, and — critically — coverage that extends beyond $ASTS into the broader space and connectivity market. Spectrum policy, competitive landscape, launch economics, adjacent plays.

You also get access to the Short Gravity Discord — real-time notifications on new filings, patent grants, orbital maneuvers, and catalyst events as they happen, plus direct discussion with the community.

If you use the Terminal and want the full picture, not just one ticker, this is how you get it.

## Tier

**Full Spectrum — $15/mo**

Enhanced AI with deep context, full citation chains, cross-reference analysis. Market insights beyond $ASTS: spectrum, competitors, launch economics, adjacent tickers. Early access to research. Discord access with real-time filing/patent/orbital notifications.
